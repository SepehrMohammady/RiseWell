**RiseWell** is a smart, puzzle-based alarm app designed to help you wake up fully alert and mentally engaged. Unlike traditional alarms that let you snooze indefinitely, RiseWell ensures you're truly awake before silencing the alarm.

## 🌅 What is RiseWell?

RiseWell combines **cognitive challenges** with **adaptive difficulty** to create a wake-up experience that:

- **Activates your brain** - Solve puzzles before dismissing alarms
- **Adapts to your behavior** - Difficulty increases with each snooze
- **Reinforces learning** - Optional flash memory quizzes during wake-up
- **Verifies alertness** - Heart rate monitoring to confirm you're awake

## ✨ Features

### 🧩 Puzzle-Based Dismissal
Simple snooze buttons are history. To dismiss your alarm, you must solve a cognitive puzzle that scales in difficulty based on your snooze count.

### 🎯 Auto-Adaptive Difficulty
The more you snooze, the harder the puzzles become. This encourages actually waking up rather than hitting snooze repeatedly.

### 🧠 Flash Memory Learning
Add your own flash cards (vocabulary, facts, formulas) and answer one correctly to complete the wake-up process. Turn mornings into productive learning moments.

### ❤️ Heart Rate Verification
Optional PPG-based heart rate monitoring ensures you're physically awake and alert before the alarm dismisses.

### 📊 Wake Statistics
Track your wake-up performance over time with detailed statistics including snooze counts, puzzle completion times, and wakefulness scores.

### 🔔 Custom Alarm Sounds
Choose from 5 built-in alarm tones to find the perfect sound to start your day.
